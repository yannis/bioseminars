      You need to change a setting in your web browser
    %p
      bioSeminars requires a browser feature called <strong>JavaScript</strong>. All modern browsers support JavaScript. You probably just need to change a setting in order to turn it on.

      Please see: <a href="http://www.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=23852">How to enable JavaScript in your browser</a>.

      If you use ad-blocking software, it may require you to allow JavaScript from bioseminars.unige.ch.

      Once you've enabled JavaScript you can
      = link_to('try loading this page again')+'.'

      Thank you.
